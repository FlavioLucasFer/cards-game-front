# Running the app

### prerequisites

    - NodeJs LTS
    - NPM package manager LTS

## Installing the dependencies

You need the *yarn* package manager to run the projects commands, so, to install *yarn* type on the root of the project:

    npm i yarn

If you want to install *yarn* globally, then type:

    npm i yarn -g

If you already have *yarn* installed, go ahead.

Now, to install the dependencies, type:

    yarn i 

if some problem occurs with *yarn i* try *npm i* instead.

    <b>note</b>: if you don't want to install *yarn* anyway, you can trade most of the command by the refferent *npm* command.
